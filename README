I made this app for myself to check what subscriptions are deducted every month.
Sure, I could have just found one on my phone but I thought I would just do it myself.

This was created for my own personal use.
But feel free to use it as well. Maybe even give me suggestions!

It functions well. Its responsive. It saves.

This is a great start and I could use it in the future for other things.

Features I would possibly add: 
1. Are you sure you want to delete this item (BUTTON)?
2. CSS styles (copy and pasted from some wesbite LOL)
3. Android/IOS app.
